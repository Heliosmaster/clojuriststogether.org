Title: FAQ


## Are my donations tax deductible?

Clojurists Together is a member project of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org). This means that we are able to accept 501\(c)3 donations. While we can't provide members with country-specific tax advice, we're not aware of any non-US country that that recognizes donations to a US public charity as tax-deductible in their jurisdiction. If you have any questions, please [get in touch](/contact) or talk to your accountant.

When we receive a donation or sponsorship payment, we send a standard acknowledgment which includes information about Conservancy's status as a US 501(c)(3) charity.Â 

## Who are you?

Clojurists Together is run by a board made up of developers in the Clojure Community. There are annual board elections to elect board members. There are seven current [board members](/team).

## How do members help influence project selections?

Every quarter before we select projects for a funding round, we send all our members a survey, asking for their feedback on what projects, tools, and areas of the Clojure ecosystem they think would benefit from being sponsored.

## Who picks the winners?

The Clojurists Together [board members](/team) look at the projects that applied for that quarter and each vote on which projects they think will be the best fit for what our members are looking for. You can see more about the process on our [open-source](/open-source) application page.

## How do you decide on the structure of the grants?

Currently the grant structure is:

* Every three months
* Fund two projects
* $1,800/mo ($5,400/quarter)

The paperwork required to administer the grants stays roughly the same even if the funding length or funding amount changes. At our current levels of support, funding more projects for less money, or doing more frequent funding rounds would add more administrative overhead. However we are still interested in alternative funding models. If you have any ideas, please let us know.

## How can I manage my PayPal payments and membership level?

[Updating your PayPal account](/docs/paypal-update) steps can be found here.

Log in to your PayPal account, go to your Profile page, and click My Preapproved Payments. From there you can cancel your subscription. After you have cancelled, you can go through the signup process again at your new membership level. Send us a note if you run into trouble and we'll help sort it out.

## Is this related to Clojure/Core?

Clojurists Together is run by Clojars, and is not associated with the fine folks at [Cognitect](https://cognitect.com), or the core Clojure development team.

## What if I don't like how you're spending my money?

Clojurists Together takes feedback for every funding round on which projects and areas to focus on. If you're not happy with how Clojurists Together spends your money, you're free to cancel your membership at any time. We take [transparency](/transparency) very seriously, and want you to have full confidence in how your money is being spent.

## I can't commit to a monthly membership, can I make a one-off donation?

Absolutely, you can make a donation via PayPal or Credit Card here:

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">

</form>

If PayPal/Credit Card doesn't work for you, then please get in touch, as there are other payment options we can use.

## I can't use PayPal, do you have other payment options?

The only way we can currently setup recurring subscriptions is through PayPal. The Software Freedom Conservancy does have [other options](https://sfconservancy.org/donate/) for one-off payments though. You can also make a one-off credit card payment through the link in the [section above](#one-off-donation). If you'd prefer to use one of those options, we're happy to process your payment as an annual subscription. This helps us minimise the paperwork and admin time involved for everyone. In all cases, please [get in touch](/contact/) with us and we'll work something out and make sure that your payment is marked for Clojurists Together and you get signed up for a subscription.

## I still have questions?

No problem, get in [contact](/contact) and we'll try and answer your questions.
