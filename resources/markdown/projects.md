# Currently Funded Projects

## Q1 2019

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org">Neanderthal<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

Neanderthal is a fast native-speed matrix and linear algebra library written in Clojure. Matrices and linear algebra are the infrastructure for high performance scientific software, including machine learning. Dragan is going to be working on adding higher-level tutorials that give people the bigger picture and shows them good practices.

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://aleph.io">Aleph<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>
<p class="project-logo"><img src="/logos/projects/aleph.svg" alt="Aleph logo"></p>

Aleph is one the best options for creating high-performance communication systems in Clojure, including but not limited to HTTP & websocket clients & servers. It is based on Netty, a high performance network application framework. A partial list of projects/companies who rely on Aleph to be maintained can be found at ztellman/aleph#450.

Development of Aleph also has an impact on the entire server-side libraries ecosystem, including direct influence by backporting bug fixes to such projects like clj-http (Clojure), Netty (Java) and potentially Ring (Clojure); and indirect influence by pushing boundaries and expending interest in the field.

# Previously Funded Projects

## Q4 2018

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha">Kaocha<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

Kaocha is a Clojure test tool. Kaocha raises the bar for what to expect from tools and provides a platform for innovation and collaboration. Clojure does not have the strongest testing culture, and has not had as much investment into test tooling as other communities. Better tooling would encourage better testing practices, a better testing culture would encourage investing in tooling. Arne Brasseur is the main (and sole) developer of Kaocha.

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript">Datascript<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<p class="project-logo"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript"><img src="/logos/projects/datascript.svg" alt="Datascript logo"></a></p>

Datascript is a Clojure and ClojureScript database. DataScript has been around for 3+ years, has gotten massive interest from the community, is used in in several production projects (listed on GitHub page), and has been starred on GitHub 3000+ times. Nikita Prokotov is the project creator, and currently maintains Datascript.

## Q3 2018

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://cljdoc.org">cljdoc<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<p class="project-logo">
<a target="_blank" href="https://cljdoc.org"><img src="/logos/projects/cljdoc-logo.svg" alt="cljdoc logo"></a>
</p>

cljdoc is a website that builds and hosts documentation for Clojure and ClojureScript libraries. Poor and out-of-date documentation has long been a complaint of Clojure developers. cljdoc [improves the state](https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc#rationale) of Clojure documentation by providing minimal-effort documentation building and hosting for all Clojure jars on Clojars and Maven. In our most recent survey, improving documentation was a common request. Martin Klepsch maintains cljdoc.

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs">Shadow CLJS<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<p class="project-logo">
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs"><img src="/logos/projects/shadow-cljs.png" alt="shadow-cljs logo"/></a>
</p>

Shadow CLJS is a ClojureScript build tool that covers the entire spectrum from development and testing to production builds. It assumes no prior knowledge of the JVM or Clojure to get started, which makes it more accessible to a broader audience. Thomas Heller maintains Shadow CLJS.

## Q2 2018

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<p class="project-logo">
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider"><img src="/logos/projects/cider-logo.svg" alt="Cider logo"/></a>
</p>

CIDER is the most widely adopted Clojure development environment. In the most recent [Clojure survey](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2017/1/31/clojure-2018-results) CIDER was the primary development environment for 50% of survey respondents. Additionally, in our most recent survey, it featured highly as a project important to our members workflows. It is maintained by Bozhidar Batsov.

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://clojurescript.org">ClojureScript<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<p class="project-logo">
<a target="_blank" href="https://clojurescript.org"> <img src="/logos/projects/cljs-logo.svg" alt="ClojureScript logo"/></a>
</p>

ClojureScript probably needs little introduction to most readers here. It is a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript to be able to target the browser, NodeJS, and the dozens of other platforms where JavaScript has a runtime. 83% of our members use ClojureScript in their work. We are funding Mike Fikes to continue his excellent work on the ClojureScript compiler. Mike is the number 2 or 3 [contributor](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/graphs/contributors) to ClojureScript (depending on how you count). 

## Q1 2018

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http">clj-http<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

clj-http is one of the most popular Clojure open source projects, with over 3 million downloads on Clojars. It is maintained by Lee Hinman. It's used by quite a few other clients as a base HTTP client.

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel">Figwheel<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

Figwheel is one of ClojureScript's secret weapons, enabling ridiculously high productivity via live-reloading ClojureScript code. It is maintained by Bruce Hauman. It is one of the most used ClojureScript tools in the community.
