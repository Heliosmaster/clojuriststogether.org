# Currently Funded Projects

## Q4 2018

### Kaocha

[Kaocha](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha) is a Clojure test tool. Kaocha raises the bar for what to expect from tools and provides a platform for innovation and collaboration. Clojure does not have the strongest testing culture, and has not had as much investment into test tooling as other communities. Better tooling would encourage better testing practices, a better testing culture would encourage investing in tooling. Arne Brasseur is the main (and sole) developer of Kaocha.

### Datascript

[Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) is a Clojure and ClojureScript database. DataScript has been around for 3+ years, has gotten massive interest from the community, is used in in several production projects (listed on GitHub page), and has been starred on GitHub 3000+ times. Nikita Prokotov is the project creator, and currently maintains Datascript.

## Q3 2018

### cljdoc

[cljdoc](https://cljdoc.xyz) is a website that builds and hosts documentation for Clojure and ClojureScript libraries. Poor and out-of-date documentation has long been a complaint of Clojure developers. cljdoc [improves the state](https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc#rationale) of Clojure documentation by providing minimal-effort documentation building and hosting for all Clojure jars on Clojars and Maven. In our most recent survey, improving documentation was a common request. Martin Klepsch maintains cljdoc.

### Shadow CLJS

[Shadow CLJS](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) is a ClojureScript build tool that covers the entire spectrum from development and testing to production builds. It assumes no prior knowledge of the JVM or Clojure to get started, which makes it more accessible to a broader audience. Thomas Heller maintains Shadow CLJS.

## Q2 2018

### CIDER

[CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) is the most widely adopted Clojure development environment. In the most recent [Clojure survey](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2017/1/31/clojure-2018-results) CIDER was the primary development environment for 50% of survey respondents. Additionally, in our most recent survey, it featured highly as a project important to our members workflows. It is maintained by Bozhidar Batsov.

### ClojureScript

ClojureScript probably needs little introduction to most readers here. It is a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript to be able to target the browser, NodeJS, and the dozens of other platforms where JavaScript has a runtime. 83% of our members use ClojureScript in their work. We are funding Mike Fikes to continue his excellent work on the ClojureScript compiler. Mike is the number 2 or 3 [contributor](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/graphs/contributors) to ClojureScript (depending on how you count). 

## Q1 2018

### clj-http

[clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http) is one of the most popular Clojure open source projects, with over 3 million downloads on Clojars. It is maintained by Lee Hinman. It's used by quite a few other clients as a base HTTP client.

### Figwheel

[Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) is one of ClojureScript's secret weapons, enabling ridiculously high productivity via live-reloading ClojureScript code. It is maintained by Bruce Hauman. It is one of the most used ClojureScript tools in the community.
