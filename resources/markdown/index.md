## Funding critical Clojure open source software

Clojurists Together is an organisation run by [Clojars](https://clojars.org), dedicated to funding and supporting open source software, infrastructure, and documentation that is important to the Clojure and ClojureScript community.

Goals

* Support open source software, infrastructure, and documentation that the Clojure/ClojureScript community relies on.
* Support other community initiatives like Google Summer of Code

## How it works

### Open source projects

Open source maintainers apply for funding, and if accepted, get paid to work on their project to make it better for everyone. Clojurists Together funds projects in three month cycles.
