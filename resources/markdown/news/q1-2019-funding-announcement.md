## Recap

For those who are new to Clojurists Together, our goal is simple: Fund critical Clojure open-source projects to keep them healthy and sustainable. Clojure companies and individual developers sign up for a monthly contribution, and we pick projects to fund each quarter. This funding cycle is our fifth. Previously we have supported [cljdoc](https://cljdoc.xyz), [Shadow CLJS](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs), [clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/), [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel), [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org), and [CIDER](http://www.cider.mx/en/latest/).

## Q1 2019 Funding

We had a bunch of great applications from great projects; we would have liked to fund several more projects if we had the money. If you'd like to see more projects get funded, then please join. If you applied for the last funding cycle, you can re-use that application to [apply](/open-source/) for Q1 2019. If you maintain a Clojure/ClojureScript project that is important to the community, consider applying for funding so we can help you keep it sustainable.

Lastly, a big thank you to all of our [members](/members/). We couldn't have done it without your support.
