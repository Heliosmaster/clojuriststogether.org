The candidates are (in a randomised order) Nola Stowe, Laurens Van Houtven, Nicolas Modryzk, Ghadi Shayban, John Stevenson, and Travis McNeill.

I'm an information security person. My background is in cryptography, but these days I mostly focus on cloud infrastructure, though I do a ton of IT security and application security as well. I'm a Principal and co-founder at Latacora, where we specifically bootstrap information security practices for startups.

I've been using Clojure for over five years now, both personally and professionally. I've been a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation for about a decade, and have been heavily involved in PyCon organization in particular. PyCon is an annual Python conference of about 3500 people, for which I managed the Financial Aid program for several years. I expect this experience will help me to successfully serve on the Clojurists Together board. (Psst! Wanna know a secret? The PyCon financial aid process was briefly entirely dependent on a piece of Clojure code to do hotel room assignments.)

In my spare time, I do woodworking and miscellaneous makery things (CNC plasma cutters and lasers, that sort of thing). I have an adorable mutt named Enzo (after Ferrari). I live in and generally adore Chicago.

### Nicolas Modrzyk - Karabiner Software

Nico has gathered the best of all countries he has lived in, Powerful French wines straight from the cradle, deep taste Guinness from Ireland, Tasty Curry from India, Chinese dumplings and ducks in China, and Japanese Sushi at the finger for the last few years.

International Geek, focusing on getting the job right and done, loves to push friends and team members to give their best to start and reach the goal.
Nico has been involved into designing large scales server applications for a video conferencing company, managing enormous gigantic clusters of databases through hand written middleware, boosting Japanese design companies with Content Management and Process Management systems, pushing the boundaries of Business Processes for Leading Financial Asia Businesses, and now enjoying independent consulting around the world.

During his spare times, write books, play live music and looking forward to some great project together.
