Title: Join the Clojurists Together Committee
type: "post"
draft: true

As we near the close of our first year at Clojurists Together, we are opening up elections for new committee positions. The Committee is responsible for governing the projects, selecting which projects are sponsored, administering the projects, and interacting with sponsors. This year, we had 7 committee members:

* Toby Crawley - Toby is a maintainer of [Clojars](https://clojars.org).
* Bridget Hillyer
* Maria Geller
* Devin Walters
* Daniel Solano GÃ³mez
* Larry Staton Jr
* [Daniel Compton](https://danielcompton.net) (project leader) - Daniel is a maintainer of [Clojars](https://clojars.org) and runs [Deps](https://www.deps.co), a private Maven repository service.

Of the 7 original committee members, only 4 will stay on for the next year. We are now implementing 2-year staggered terms.

If you are interested in joining the Committee this year, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeW9P_4Z5jon792l_63fAUzbAocG4D3tDIDWp30TCgobIduEg/viewform?usp=sf_link) by November 1, 2018. Elections will be held for our community once the electees are announced, and any Clojurists Together members are invited to participate and vote. 

The new Clojurists Together Committee will be announced just prior to the Clojure Conference in ___ at the end of November. 

Please share with anyone you think would be interested in applying. Thanks for your support of Clojurists Together, we appreciate the support!
