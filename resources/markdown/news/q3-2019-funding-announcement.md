Clojurists Together is happy to announce that for Q3 of 2019 (August-November) we are funding three projects: 

*[Shadow](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) with Thomas Heller
*[Meander](https://github.com/noprompt/meander) with Joel Holdbrooks
*CIDER with Bozhidar Batsov

## Recap

For those who are new to Clojurists Together, our goal is simple: Fund critical Clojure open-source projects to keep them healthy and sustainable. Clojure companies and individual developers sign up for a monthly contribution, and we pick projects to fund each quarter. This funding cycle is our fifth. Previously we have supported [datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript), [kaocha](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha), [cljdoc](https://cljdoc.xyz), [Shadow CLJS](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs), [clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/), [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel), [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org), [CIDER](http://www.cider.mx/en/latest/), [Aleph](https://aleph.io), [Neanderthal](https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org), and [Fireplace](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace).

## Funding details

We support our grantees by paying them a total of $9,000 over three months ($3,000/mo).

## Shadow cljs

Shadow-cljs is a fully featured CLJS build tool with seamless integration into the npm ecosystem.

### Thomas' plans for the next three months are:

Finalize and properly document react-native/expo support. More detailed documentation for all build targets with proper up-to-date examples, including proper deployment examples using common platforms.

## Meander

I believe Meander is poised to be an important contribution to the Clojure community because it provides a uniquely transparent way of performing data manipulation that aims to be declarative, performant, and safe. These properties are important because they enable Clojure developers to write correct data manipulation code using a common language which encourages collaboration and thoughtful design without sacrificing dynamism. And because Meander has been designed with both transparency and accuracy in mind, Clojure code written with it can be an asset to a development team and, thus, a business.

### Joel's plans for the next three months are:

I plan to invest heavily in my next version of the library: epsilon. I am currently unemployed and all of my free time that isn't spent on becoming employed is being spent on the project. My primary goals for this funding would be to improve the performance of the code emitted by the pattern matching and substitution compilers, begin working on a compiler specifically for rewriting (matching + substitution), and greatly improving the documentation.

## CIDER

CIDER is very popular programming environment and it's infrastructure (nREPL, cider-nrepl, piggieback and orchard) powers many of the other tools out there (e.g. vim-fireplace, vim-iced, calva, etc). Improvements to CIDER and it's foundational pieces generally benefits most of the Clojure community. 

### Bozhidar's plans for the next three months are:

* Improve the projects home page and documentation portal with a focus on improved onboarding for newcomers
* Add cider-nrepl documentation to the documentation portal
* Improve the nREPL docs portal (e.g. add search, more info or writing extensions, etc)
* Add support for client-side dep injection to nREPL
* Clean up the APIs of orchard and cider-nrepl and make them more uniform
* Improve the api docs for orchard and cider-nrepl
* Make the indentation in clojure-mode a bit more flexible (e.g. support using `;`)
* Various small cleanups and improvements to CIDER in preparation for a 1.0 release (e.g. making it easier to specify a custom form to start a ClojureScript REPL, make the shortcuts in the debugger customizable, inject ClojureScript deps in jack-in, etc)
* Learn more about ClojureScript, so I can improve the support for it :-)
* 2-3 monthly instalments in the "Hard CIDER" blog series
* An "Intro to CIDER" screencast

## Q3 2019 Funding

We had a bunch of great applications from great projects. If you'd like to see more projects get funded, then please join. If you applied for the last funding cycle, you can re-use that application to [apply](/open-source/) for Q4 2019-2020. If you maintain a Clojure/ClojureScript project that is important to the community, consider applying for funding so we can help you keep it sustainable.

Lastly, a big thank you to all of our [members](/members/). We couldn't have done it without your support.
