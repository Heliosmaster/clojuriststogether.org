type: "post"
draft: true

As we near the close of our first year at Clojurists Together, we are opening up elections for new committee positions. As part of our commitment to [transparency](/transparency/) and community governance, Clojurists Together holds annual elections. The Committee is responsible for governing the projects, selecting which projects are sponsored, administering the projects, and interacting with sponsors. This year, we had seven committee members:

* Toby Crawley
* Bridget Hillyer
* Maria Geller
* Devin Walters
* Daniel Solano Gómez
* Larry Staton Jr
* Daniel Compton (project leader)

Committee members are elected for a two-year term. Of the seven original committee members, four will stay on for the second year of a two-year staggered term (Maria Geller, Daniel Solano Gómez, Larry Staton Jr, and Daniel Compton).

If you are interested in joining the Committee this year, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeW9P_4Z5jon792l_63fAUzbAocG4D3tDIDWp30TCgobIduEg/viewform?usp=sf_link) by midnight end-of-day November 1, 2018 Pacific Time. If you can't access the form, [contact us](/contact/), and we can accept your nomination by email. Elections will be held for our community once the candidates are announced, and all Clojurists Together members will be eligible to vote.
