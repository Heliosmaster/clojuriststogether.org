We have recently run our second survey on our [members](/members/) to better understand them and their needs. We're publishing these results so that they can see the aggregate results, and to give open source projects more information when [applying](/open-source/) for the Q2 2018 Clojurists Together funding round (closing 22 April).

## Survey Responses

There were 52 respondents to the survey, up from 27 in the last survey. The highlights are presented below.

* ClojureScript - 43 (83%)
* Clojure CLR - 0 (0%)

### Which platforms do you target?

* Clojure JVM Server (96%)
* ClojureScript Browser (79%)

### Which projects in the Clojure ecosystem are important to your workflow?

<!-- pbpaste | tr ',' '\n' | tr [A-Z] [a-z] | awk '{$1=$1};1' | sort  | uniq -c |sort -r -->

This was a new question that we asked of our members, here are the projects that were mentioned at least three times:

* 13 figwheel

* 7 re-frame
* 6 ring
* 5 spec
* 5 reagent
* 5 core.async

### Would you/have you recommended Clojurists Together to a friend?

Would you: 96% said yes, 4% said no.

Have you: 62% said yes, 38% said no.

### What are we doing well, what could we be doing better?

Doing well:

* Supporting projects
* Communication
* Picking good projects to fund
* Transparency

Could do better:

* More transparency on project selection
* Getting more companies to sign up and open their checkbooks/growing
* Marketing
* Support Google Summer of Code

Based on these survey results, we've made some changes to how we show which projects are selected, now all projects that applied are listed and we show the voting results for all projects with everything below the top 5 redacted.

If you'd like to see more companies sponsor Clojurists Together, please reach out to them and encourage them to join.

## Call For Proposals

If you are a maintainer of an open source Clojure project, we'd encourage you to consider [applying](/open-source/) for the Q2 funding round. If you maintain a project that was mentioned either directly, or as one of the survey respondents' focuses, then we'd _highly_ encourage you to consider applying. Applications will close on 22 April. If you know of a project that you think would be a good fit for Clojurists Together, please encourage them to apply. If you have any questions or would like any help with your application, please [get in touch](/contact).
