Clojurists Together is happy to announce that for Q3 of 2018 (August-October) we are funding two projects: cljdoc and Shadow CLJS.

## Recap

For those who are new to Clojurists Together, our goal is simple: Fund critical Clojure open-source projects to keep them healthy and sustainable. Clojure companies and individual developers sign up for a monthly contribution, and we pick projects to fund each quarter. This funding cycle is our third. Previously we have supported [clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/), [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel), [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org), and [CIDER](http://www.cider.mx/en/latest/).

## cljdoc

[cljdoc](https://cljdoc.xyz) is a website that builds and hosts documentation for Clojure and ClojureScript libraries. Poor and out-of-date documentation has long been a complaint of Clojure developers. cljdoc [improves the state](https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc#rationale) of Clojure documentation by providing minimal-effort documentation building and hosting for all Clojure jars on Clojars and Maven. In our most recent survey, improving documentation was a common request. Martin Klepsch maintains cljdoc.

Martin's plans for the next three months are:

- Integrate Clojure specs
- Integrate user-contributed examples
- Add offline documentation downloads (Dash/Zeal integration)
- Improve the overall user experience / UI
- Support users and make them aware cljdoc exists and can help them
- Build an active community around this project, ensure there's more than just him developing it

## Shadow CLJS

[Shadow CLJS](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) is a ClojureScript build tool that covers the entire spectrum from development and testing to production builds. It assumes no prior knowledge of the JVM or Clojure to get started, which makes it more accessible to a broader audience. Thomas Heller maintains Shadow CLJS.

Thomas's plans for the next three months are:

- Continue working on improving stability
- Continue working on usability
- Improve the documentation for the project
- Provide a templating mechanism for starting new Shadow CLJS projects.

## Funding details

Each project receives a grant of $1,800USD/mo for three months.

## Voting details

The projects that applied were:

- [cljs-i18n](https://github.com/thedavidmeister/cljs-i18n)
- [cljdoc](https://cljdoc.xyz)
- [Shadow CLJS](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs)
- [Light Table](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable)
- [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)

## Q4 Funding

We had a bunch of great applications from great projects; we would have liked to fund several more projects if we had the money. If you'd like to see more projects get funded, then please join. If you applied for the last funding cycle, you can re-use that application to [apply](/open-source/) for Q4. If you maintain a Clojure/ClojureScript project that is important to the community, consider applying for funding so we can help you keep it sustainable.

Lastly, a big thank you to all of our [members](/members/). We couldn't have done it without your support.
