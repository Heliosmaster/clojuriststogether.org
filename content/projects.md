<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

Ring is the most commonly used HTTP abstraction layer for Clojure. Clojurists Together funded James Reeves, Ring's maintainer to build out a draft spec and experimental alpha for Ring 2.0. This will add better support for asynchronous HTTP connections, and pave the way to support HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 in future. As a secondary objective, he is also working on removing the provided dependency on Java servlets from Ring core

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://reagent-project.github.io">Reagent<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

Based on Clojars downloads Reagent is the most used ClojureScript React wrapper. Reagent is also one of the most popular ClojureScript projects on GitHub with 3.7k stars. Juho Tepieri is a maintainer of Reagent and will be working on supporting React Hooks, and a configurable Reagent Hiccup compiler.

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva">Calva<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

</p>

Calva is a Clojure IDE plugin for VS Code. Calva helps new Clojurists get up and running with Clojure without having to worry so much about tooling. VS Code has become a major platform for developers and it's important to have Clojure(Script) support in the developers' editor of choice. We funded Brandon Ringe, a Calva maintainer to work on supporting large data sets and Clojure debugging support.

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace">fireplace.vim<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

Tim Pope is the maintainer of Fireplace.vim, a Clojure plugin for Vim. In the most recent Clojure survey it was used by 10% of respondents. We funded Tim to work on: Leveraging Vim's recently added asynchronous APIs for user facing features, providing better automatic configuration for projects, notably Shadow CLJS, and working on outstanding feature requests.

While ClojureScript offers a first class front-end development experience, data visualization specifically has long been an under-served need in both Clojure & ClojureScript. Oz gives ClojureScript developers the ability to leverage Vega-Lite and Vega, with their Clojuresque data-driven/declarative design, and close this gap. Oz is maintained by Chistopher Small.

### Q3 2019

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<p class="project-logo">
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider"><img src="/logos/projects/cider-logo.svg" alt="Cider logo"/></a>
</p>

CIDER is a very popular programming environment and it's infrastructure (nREPL, cider-nrepl, piggieback and orchard) powers many of the other tools out there (e.g. vim-fireplace, vim-iced, calva, etc). Improvements to CIDER and it's foundational pieces generally benefits most of the Clojure community. It is maintained by Bozhidar Batsov.

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs">Shadow CLJS<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<p class="project-logo">
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs"><img src="/logos/projects/shadow-cljs.png" alt="shadow-cljs logo"/></a>
</p>

Shadow CLJS is a ClojureScript build tool that covers the entire spectrum from development and testing to production builds. It assumes no prior knowledge of the JVM or Clojure to get started, which makes it more accessible to a broader audience. Thomas Heller maintains Shadow CLJS.

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/noprompt/meander">Meander<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

Meander provides a uniquely transparent way of performing data manipulation that aims to be declarative, performant, and safe. These properties are important because they enable Clojure developers to write correct data manipulation code using a common language which encourages collaboration and thoughtful design without sacrificing dynamism. And because Meander has been designed with both transparency and accuracy in mind, Clojure code written with it can be an asset to a development team and, thus, a business. It is maintained by Joel Holdbrooks.

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva">Calva<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<p class="project-logo">
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva"><img src="/logos/projects/calva.svg" alt="calva logo"/></a>
</p>

VS Code is the editor of choice for many developers and having good Clojure and ClojureScript support on the platform helps newcomers find the joy of Clojure faster. VS Code also is easier to use than many other development environments, and by leveraging this, Calva can make Clojure more accessible generally. It is maintained by Peter Str√∂mberg.

### Q2 2019

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace">Fireplace.vim<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

Fireplace is a vim plugin for Clojure. It adds REPL integration and was used by 10% of Clojure developers in the most recent Clojure survey. It is the most popular Clojure REPL integration for vim. Tim Pope is going to work on cleaning up the issue tracker, implementing support for Vim 8 and Neovim job support, looking at ClojureScript improvements, and various other fixes and improvements to fireplace.vim and sibling projects like [salve.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-salve)

### Q1 2019

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org">Neanderthal<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

Neanderthal is a fast native-speed matrix and linear algebra library written in Clojure. Matrices and linear algebra are the infrastructure for high performance scientific software, including machine learning. Dragan Djuric is going to be working on adding higher-level tutorials that give people the bigger picture and shows them good practices.

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://aleph.io">Aleph<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>
<p class="project-logo"><img src="/logos/projects/aleph.svg" alt="Aleph logo"></p>

Aleph is one the best options for creating high-performance communication systems in Clojure, including but not limited to HTTP & websocket clients & servers. It is based on Netty, a high performance network application framework.

Development of Aleph also has an impact on the entire server-side libraries ecosystem, including direct influence by backporting bug fixes to such projects like clj-http (Clojure), Netty (Java) and potentially Ring (Clojure); and indirect influence by pushing boundaries and expending interest in the field.

### Q4 2018

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha">Kaocha<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

Kaocha is a Clojure test tool. Kaocha raises the bar for what to expect from tools and provides a platform for innovation and collaboration. Clojure does not have the strongest testing culture, and has not had as much investment into test tooling as other communities. Better tooling would encourage better testing practices, a better testing culture would encourage investing in tooling. Arne Brasseur is the main (and sole) developer of Kaocha.

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript">Datascript<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

</p>

cljdoc is a website that builds and hosts documentation for Clojure and ClojureScript libraries. Poor and out-of-date documentation has long been a complaint of Clojure developers. cljdoc [improves the state](https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc#rationale) of Clojure documentation by providing minimal-effort documentation building and hosting for all Clojure jars on Clojars and Maven. In our most recent survey, improving documentation was a common request. Martin Klepsch maintains cljdoc.

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs">Shadow CLJS<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<p class="project-logo">
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider"><img src="/logos/projects/cider-logo.svg" alt="Cider logo"/></a>
</p>

CIDER is the most widely adopted Clojure development environment. In the most recent [Clojure survey](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2017/1/31/clojure-2018-results) CIDER was the primary development environment for 50% of survey respondents. Additionally, in our most recent survey, it featured highly as a project important to our members workflows. It is maintained by Bozhidar Batsov.

<h3 class="project"><a target="_blank" href="https://clojurescript.org">ClojureScript<img class="open-in-new" src="/icons/open-in-new-24px.svg" alt="open in new tab icon"/></a></h3>

<p class="project-logo">
<a target="_blank" href="https://clojurescript.org"> <img src="/logos/projects/cljs-logo.svg" alt="ClojureScript logo"/></a>
</p>

ClojureScript probably needs little introduction to most readers here. It is a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript to be able to target the browser, NodeJS, and the dozens of other platforms where JavaScript has a runtime. 83% of our members use ClojureScript in their work. We are funding Mike Fikes to continue his excellent work on the ClojureScript compiler. Mike is the number 2 or 3 [contributor](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/graphs/contributors) to ClojureScript (depending on how you count).
