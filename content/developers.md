## Tax deductibility

Some countries allow you to deduct membership dues to a trade association from your personal income taxes. We aren't able to provide individual advice, we recommend talking with your tax professional to see if this applies to you. If you have any questions, please [get in touch](/contact).

## Free memberships

We also offer free memberships for people who would like to be a member, but aren't able to pay for a membership. For more details [contact us](/contact).
