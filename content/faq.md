## Are my payments tax deductible?

Clojurists Together is a trade organisation that charges membership dues to companies and individuals. Whether your dues are deductible depends on whether you are a company or individual, and your local tax rules. We aren't able to provide individual tax advice to our members.

<!-- However, what we have seen in the US is that companies with a business interest in the trade association's activities can treat membership dues like any other business expense. Generally speaking, the same rules apply to non-US businesses.

> Contributions to section 501(c)(6) organizations are not deductible as charitable contributions on the donor’s federal income tax return. They may be deductible as trade or business expenses if ordi­nary and necessary in the conduct of the taxpayer’s business. - [IRS Tax treatment of donations - 501(c)(6) organizations](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/other-non-profits/tax-treatment-of-donations-501c6-organizations)

For individuals, the situation depends much more on your exact corporate structure (self-employed vs. employed), and your local tax rules. In all cases, please talk to your tax professional to determine your individual situation. If you have any questions, please [get in touch](/contact) or talk to your accountant. -->

When we receive membership dues, we automatically send an invoice with identifying information for the payment.

## Who are you?

Clojurists Together is run by a board made up of developers in the Clojure Community. There are annual board elections to elect board members. There are seven current [board members](/team).

## How do members help influence project selections?

Every quarter before we select projects for a funding round, we send all our members a survey, asking for their feedback on what projects, tools, and areas of the Clojure ecosystem they think would benefit from being sponsored.

## Who picks the winners?

The Clojurists Together [board members](/team) look at the projects that applied for that quarter and each vote on which projects they think will be the best fit for what our members are looking for. You can see more about the process on our [open-source](/open-source) application page.

## How do you decide on the structure of the grants?

Currently the grant structure is:

* Every three months
* Fund four projects
* $3,000/mo ($9,000/quarter)

The paperwork required to administer the grants stays roughly the same even if the funding length or funding amount changes. At our current levels of support, funding more projects for less money, or doing more frequent funding rounds would add more administrative overhead. However we are still interested in alternative funding models. If you have any ideas, please let us know.

## How can I manage my PayPal payments and membership level?

[Updating your PayPal account](/docs/paypal-update) steps can be found here.

Log in to your PayPal account, go to your Profile page, and click My Preapproved Payments. From there you can cancel your subscription. After you have cancelled, you can go through the signup process again at your new membership level. Send us a note if you run into trouble and we'll help sort it out.

## Is this related to Clojure/Core?

Clojurists Together is run by Clojars, and is not associated with the fine folks at [Cognitect](https://cognitect.com), or the core Clojure development team.

## What if I don't like how you're spending my money?

Clojurists Together takes feedback for every funding round on which projects and areas to focus on. If you're not happy with how Clojurists Together spends your money, you're free to cancel your membership at any time. We take [transparency](/transparency) very seriously, and want you to have full confidence in how your money is being spent.

## I can't commit to a monthly membership, can I make a one-off contribution?

Yes, get in [contact](/contact) and we can setup a one-time payment.

## What is the history of Clojurists Together?

Clojurists Together (via Clojars) was originally formed as a member project of the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>. In early 2020, Clojurists Together left Conservancy to form the Clojurists Together Foundation, a US corporation. Our mission is the same, but forming our own organisation has freed up our admin resources so that we can focus on fundraising, marketing, and funding new and different projects.

## I don't have a credit card, do you have other payment options?

We use Stripe for accepting credit card payments. If you don't have access to a credit card, we can also accept ACH or US wire transfers through Stripe. If you'd like to pay by ACH or wire transfer, please [get in touch](/contact/) and we can send you an invoice. If that doesn't work, please contact us and we'll try and we can work something out.

## I still have questions?

No problem, get in [contact](/contact) and we'll try and answer your questions.
