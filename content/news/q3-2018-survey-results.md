We have recently run our third survey on our [members](/members/) to better understand them and their needs. We're publishing these results so that they can see the aggregate results, and to give open source projects more information when [applying](/open-source/) for the Q3 2018 Clojurists Together funding round (closing 20 July).

## Survey Responses

There were 49 respondents to the survey, down from 52 in the last survey. The highlights are presented below.

### Which Clojure dialects do you regularly use?

- Clojure - 49 (100%)
- ClojureScript - 38 (78%)
- Clojure CLR - 0 (0%)

### Which platforms do you target?

- Clojure JVM Server (98%)
- ClojureScript Browser (78%)
- ClojureScript Mobile (22%)
- Clojure JVM Client (12%)
- ClojureScript Node Server (12%)

### What areas of Clojure would you like to see improvement in?

The main things people were interested in: error messages (77%), documentation (48%), developer experience tools (40%), IDE support (35%), build tooling (33%), and linters (27%).

### Which projects in the Clojure ecosystem are important to your workflow?

<!-- pbpaste | tr ',' '\n' | tr [A-Z] [a-z] | awk '{$1=$1};1' | sort  | uniq -c | sort -r -->

This was a new question that we asked of our members, here are the projects that were mentioned at least three times:

- 12 figwheel
- 12 cider
- 6 reagent
- 6 re-frame
- 6 leiningen
- 4 tools.deps
- 3 shadow-cljs

### Do you think the funded projects for this quarter have delivered?

This was a new question that was suggested we ask in our surveys. It was a free text choice, but 26 people said yes, 7 people said they weren't sure, and no-one said no which is good!

### How would you like us to allocate our funding?

There is a continuum of project maturity. To date we have focused mostly on mature projects where the project and/or applicant have a track record. We are looking at the possibility of funding some earlier stage, more speculative projects. These have a higher risk of not delivering what they set out to achieve, but also have the potential for a high payoff. We asked our members what kinds of projects they want us to focus on:

- Only fund established projects that have already had some success (29%)
- Fund a mix of established projects and speculative projects (69%)
- Only fund speculative projects (2%)

### What are we doing well, what could we be doing better?

Doing well:

- Communication with sponsors
- Transparency
- Selecting projects

Could do better:

- Marketing ourselves and our successes
- Explaining the direct benefits to sponsors
- Getting more funding

If you'd like to see more companies sponsor Clojurists Together, please reach out to them and encourage them to join.

## Call For Proposals

If you are a maintainer of an open source Clojure project, we'd encourage you to consider [applying](/open-source/) for the Q3 funding round. If you maintain a project that was mentioned either directly, or as one of the survey respondents' focuses, then we'd _highly_ encourage you to consider applying. Applications will close on 20 July. If you know of a project that you think would be a good fit for Clojurists Together, please encourage them to apply. If you have any questions or would like any help with your application, please [get in touch](/contact).
