Clojurists Together wants to hear from you, the open source Clojure community about how we can better serve you. You can fill out the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIha0JX1nmjZRTsrdG7g8vAvxjTgO6VQpnVsEgOPH664KLMg/viewform) today.

### Background

Now that we've been operating as a 501(c)6 for almost a year, we're wanting to talk to our members and the Clojure open source community about ideas for alternative funding structures.

For most of our life, Clojurists Together has funded projects in 3 month cycles. First for $1,800/month ($5,400/cycle), and then for $3,000 month ($9,000/cycle).

This has been a successful model but we've heard from both maintainers and members that they'd like to see us experiment with other funding models. Last year as part of the [Summer of Bugs](/news/announcing-summer-of-bugs/) where we funded 7 projects with micro-grants of $500 or $1,000. We've also been funding [Clojars](/news/clojurists-together-is-funding-clojars/) for $1,500/month.

These experiements have been successful. We've improved our processes to make contracts and payments run more smoothly.

### Ideas

Some ideas to get you thinking:

* Pay one person $5,000/month for 12 months.
* Pay 10 people $200 each for documentation patches.
* Run a mentoring program where the mentor and mentee each get paid to work on an open source project.
* Let projects choose the intensity of their program, e.g. work full time for one month, or work very part-time for 12 months but still receive the same amount.
* Have Clojurists Together commission work that they (and their members) think is valuable, rather than waiting for projects to apply for funding.

### Next steps

If you're an open source Clojure developer, we want to hear from you in [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIha0JX1nmjZRTsrdG7g8vAvxjTgO6VQpnVsEgOPH664KLMg/viewform).

If you're a Clojurists Together member, we also have a private survey that you'll receive shortly to hear more about what you'd like to see as a member.

If you have thoughts or suggestions and don't fall into either of those groups, feel free to send them through our [contact](/contact) page. Thanks!
