## Survey Responses

As the year comes to a close, we surveyed our developer and company members to find out what they wanted us to focus on 2023. Here are some of the results:


### Which platforms do you target?

### What areas of Clojure would you like to see improvement in?

### What areas of ClojureScript would you like to see improvement in?

### What areas of the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem need support?

#### Developer Tooling
- tooling, but not "more feature" but an easier way to use them
- more tools, IDE improvements and better stacktraces
- wide range of cross-area tools and libraries
- tooling and their performance 




#### Documentation, Tutorials and Beginner experience
- documentation and examples
- beginner support
- discoverability of existing tools - beginner friendly documentation
- more education and outreach to grow the userbase
- outreach to developers outside the community
- simple maintenance of "abandoned" libs, primarily semi-regular releases that bump dependencies



#### Other areas that were mentioned
- alpha version libs should leave Alpha stage sooner
- react wrappers need to be more clear
- shadow-cljs node-repl need to properly capture async stdout
- closure compiler need to able to emit "stable" modules, every build will wipe a user's cache



### What areas of the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem are strong?

- The help from the Clojurist Community on Slack ❤️
- Tooling features and performance 
- The language + tooling is super strong; we just need more people using them
- Powerful yet simple libraries (if you can find them) and build tooling
- Forward-thinking state management approaches 
- General stability
- Editors

### What would you like to be different in the Clojure community in the next 12 months?

- Stacktraces and more ides tools
- More outreach to spread info about Clojure to communities outside of the Clojure community.
- A body like Clojurists Together could be a trusted entity for taking over management of abandoned Clojure libraries.
- we can move past the spec2 alpha weirdness and settle on sensible preferred framework, e.g. Malli
- More unified documentation experience
- I'd like to see the community grow more / faster
- supporting experimental uses of clojure in new domains
- Improve leiningen and deps (and off course other libraries) to be natively GraalVM compatible. Deploying jars and combo packages is a headache for production companies.
