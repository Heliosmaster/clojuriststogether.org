Clojurists Together is starting our next funding round for Q3 2022. Applications are open until the 20th of December 2022. Apply today!

Developers can choose between two different funding tiers ($2,000 and $9,000) and can decide on the length of the funding, from 1 to 12 months (for the $9,000 tier). Funding would start from 1st of February but the start of funding can be delayed by up to two months. The $2k funding tiers are for experimental projects or smaller proposals, whereas the $9k tier is for more established projects.

We will be funding 4 $9k projects, and 4 $2k projects.

If you work on a Clojure open source project, especially one mentioned as a focus area for our members, please consider [applying](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/open-source/).

## Survey Responses

As the year comes to a close, we surveyed our developer and company members to find out what they wanted us to focus on 2023. Here are some of the results:


### Which platforms do you target?

### What areas of ClojureScript would you like to see improvement in?

### What areas of the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem need support?

#### Developer Tooling
- tooling, but not "more feature" but an easier way to use them
- more tools, IDE improvements and better stacktraces
- wide range of cross-area tools and libraries
- tooling and their performance 




#### Documentation, Tutorials and Beginner experience
- documentation and examples
- beginner support
- discoverability of existing tools - beginner friendly documentation
- more education and outreach to grow the userbase
- outreach to developers outside the community
- simple maintenance of "abandoned" libs, primarily semi-regular releases that bump dependencies



### What areas of the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem are strong?

- The help from the Clojurist Community on Slack ❤️
- Tooling features and performance 
- The language + tooling is super strong; we just need more people using them
- Powerful yet simple libraries (if you can find them) and build tooling
- Forward-thinking state management approaches 
- General stability
- Editors





### Are there any particular libraries, tools, or projects that are important to you that you would like to see supported?

### What would you like to be different in the Clojure community in the next 12 months?

- Stacktraces and more IDE tools
- More outreach to spread info about Clojure to communities outside of the Clojure community.
- A body like Clojurists Together could be a trusted entity for taking over management of abandoned Clojure libraries. [Note: We think that [clj-commons](https://clj-commons.org) is already doing a great job at this]
- More unified documentation experience
- I'd like to see the community grow more / faster
- Supporting experimental uses of clojure in new domains
- Improve leiningen and deps (and off course other libraries) to be natively GraalVM compatible. Deploying jars and combo packages is a headache for production companies.
