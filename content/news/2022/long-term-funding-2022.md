summary: "Clojurists Together is going to fund 10 developers $1.5k/month for 12 months"
---

Last year, Clojurists Together introduced a new funding type, [long-term funding](/news/long-term-funding-selections/). The goal of this funding was to:

* Give developers a predictable base of long-term funding to let them continue the excellent open-source work they've already been doing.
* Give developers money with fewer "strings attached". The grant is not tied to a particular project; we think developers can do great things when they are [free to work on whatever seems most promising to them](https://mobile.twitter.com/patrickc/status/1428166730426191877), especially over a long period.
* Give members direct influence over who gets funded.

## Last year

We gave seven developers $1,500 USD/month for 12 months, supported by our members.

* Bozhidar Batsov
* Michiel Borkent
* Dragan Djuric
* Thomas Heller
* David Nolen
* Nikita Prokopov
* Toby Crawley

These developers all did incredible work over the last year, and we were happy to be able to fund them. You can view the work they did in their monthly updates over the previous year, [including their most recent updates](/news/september-2022-monthly-update/).

## Nominations

We're now looking to do a second round of long-term funding. Thanks to Clojurists Together continued support from the Clojure community, we are going to be **funding ten developers or teams USD 1,500/month for 12 months**. Like last year, Clojurists Together members will be sent a voting form to select the developers they'd like to fund. This year, we're also accepting nominations for teams of people who work on open source together. This could be as part of a company, or just a group of people who work on open source projects together.

All Clojurists Together members will receive an email to nominate Clojure developers/teams. We will be accepting nominations until **23 October, 2022**. We will then send out a voting form to all members to vote on the developers/teams they'd like to fund.

## Thanks
