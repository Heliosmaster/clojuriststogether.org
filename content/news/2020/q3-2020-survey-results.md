Thanks so much for your support and feedback in the latest survey. This quarter we are funding four projects $9,000 each. You can [apply for funding](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/open-source/), applications are open until 6th November 11:59pm PST.

## Survey Responses

There were 60 respondents to our Q3 2020 survey. The highlights are presented below.

### What areas of Clojure would you like to see improvement in?

The main things our members were interested in:

- Developer Experience Tools
- Error Messages
- IDE support
- Data Analysis/Processing Frameworks
- Documentation
- Linters
- Debuggers
- Build tooling
- Test tooling

If you work on any of these kinds of projects, please look at applying for funding.

### Are there any particular libraries, tools, or projects that are important to you that you would like to see supported?

- shadow-cljs
- Calva
- cider
- babashka
- Fulcro
- Pathom
- clj-kondo
- datahike
- DataScript
- Malli
- Neanderthal ecosystem
- re-frame
- vim fireplace

If you're a maintainer of any of these projects, please consider applying.



### Have you seen any direct benefits from improvements to the projects we have funded?

A sampling of comments:

- I've been happy with the projects that have been funded, it's a community effort after all.
- Calva certainly seems way better than when I tried it 2 years ago
- Yes. I believe everyone who is a member of Clojurists Together benefits from what you're doing and that's why we contribute to the organization.
- Continued reliability on the Clojure ecosystem
- Happy to see support for CIDER, Oz, shadow-cljs, etc. Recent updates to Oz have been very helpful to me.
- I've appreciated the recent nrepl, reagent, and clj-kondo work
- I use approximately half the sponsored projects.
- It's good to know that Bozhidar was supported â€“ he's doing a lot of work
- Borkdude's work has really gained focus and the improvements to his libraries are great.

### How would you like us to allocate our funding?

For company members:

- 57% wanted us to fund 50% Mature, 50% speculative
- 43% wanted us to fund 75% Mature, 25% speculative

For developer members:

- 65% wanted us to fund 50% Mature, 50% speculative
- 29% wanted us to fund 75% Mature, 25% speculative
- 4% wanted us to fund 25% Mature, 75% speculative
- 2% wanted us to fund 100% Mature, 0% speculative



### What are we doing well, what could we be doing better?

Doing well:

- IDE support and core libraries
- Being transparent and well organized
- The engagement and communication to backers is really well done. Reading the mails keeps me afloat on the ecosystem
- Good choices in projects that are funded. picking a good mix of projects and the right projects to fund
- Establishing a community of support around the Clojure ecosystem, making the language ever more viable for use.


Could do better:

- Outreach, elevator pitching, making the mission even more known in companies
- More insight into how the projects to be funded are chosen.
- Fund specific people (not projects) who have demonstrated innovative thinking / tools.  Look for a way to fund quantum improvements in tools.
- Treat mature and mainstream (by democratic choice) projects specially, i.e. allocate steady significant sponsorships

Thank you!
