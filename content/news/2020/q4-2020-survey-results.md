## Survey Responses

There were 52 respondents to our Q4 2020 survey. The highlights are presented below.


### What areas of Clojure would you like to see improvement in?

The main things our members were interested in:

- Developer Experience Tools
- IDE support
- Documentation
- Test tooling
- Error Messages
- Build tooling
- Debuggers

If you work on any of these kinds of projects, please look at applying for funding.



### Are there any particular libraries, tools, or projects that are important to you that you would like to see supported?

- Babashka
- Datahike
- Re-frame
- Shadow-cljs
- Cider
- Datascript
- Malli

If you're a maintainer of any of these projects, please consider applying.



### Have you seen any direct benefits from improvements to the projects we have funded?

A sampling of comments:

- The projects funded in Q3 2020 are all really great! I'm particularly excited to see CLJ's reach expand via sci and babashka and the learning curve flattened via Practicalli tutorials.
- Yes, multiple times. We use many of the projects funded.
- Definitely! Shadow and clj-kondo have a big impact on my work.
- Yes, increased levels of updates to libraries funded
- Absolutely. @borkdude's projects.
- Yes I have, with multiple libraries and tools (like Reagent and clj-kondo).
- Yeah, incremental benefits to libraries we use (reagent, malli, vim-fireplace, figwheel)
- Calva and Shadow-cljs keep getting better, really looking forward to the next Reagent release



### How would you like us to allocate our funding?

For company members:

- 72.70% wanted us to fund 75% Mature, 25% speculative
- 27.30% wanted us to fund 50% Mature, 50% speculative


For developer members:

- 65.00% wanted us to fund 50% Mature, 50% speculative
- 30.00% wanted us to fund 75% Mature, 25% speculative
- 5.00% wanted us to fund 25% Mature, 75% speculative



### What are we doing well, what could we be doing better?

Doing well:

- Advocating on reframing how to make open source sustainable.
- Supporting developers, making a real impact, promoting involvement / investment in our community
- Initiative and communication is particularly clear
- Diverse set of projects, good transparency, and incorporating community feedback
- Giving opportunities for those without time to contribute to open source to support those with time to contribute to open source.
- Supporting key projects, keeping us informed and improving awareness of up and coming projects.



Could do better:

- Help subscribers discover interesting projects
- Find a way to get some projects on 24/7/365 funding support, so that there is a constant flow of support going to these projects
- Sherpa the progress reports of funded squads that have difficulty describing their work.
- Connect with greater sponsorship community: patreon, open collective, github sponsors, etc.
- Detail what projects have applied for funding so we know what projects are interested in receiving funding
- More behind the scenes updates. I found the REPL discussion and interviews very informative.



Thank you!
